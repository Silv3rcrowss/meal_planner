# meal_planner
A user-friendly meal planner app that streamlines meal planning, nutrition tracking, and grocery shopping while accommodating dietary preferences and promoting healthy eating habits

"""
This project aims to develop a meal planner using Python that helps users plan meals, track calorie intake, and generate grocery lists through AI integration.
The meal planner will offer features such as personalized meal suggestions, a recipe library, nutrition tracking, grocery list generation, and support for dietary restrictions.
The app will also have social and personalization features, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT API. Users will interact with the app through a user-friendly interface, while data will be stored in a MySQL database.
The backend will be developed using the Flask web framework and a RESTful API. Database models and CRUD operations for meals, users, and grocery lists will be implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM.
